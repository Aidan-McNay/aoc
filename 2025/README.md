# 2025

I'm learning Rust, so let's see how well it works!

(I also had brief ambitions about varying languages, but liked learning more about Rust more, as well as being discouraged after implementing Day 1 in MacOS ARM assembly)

## Build one day

```bash
cargo build -p day1
```

Builds as `./target/debug/day1`

## Build all days

```bash
cargo build
```

## Run a day with file input

```bash
cargo run -p day1 day1/test.txt
```
